#  Microchip MPLAB Harmony 3 Touch Library

MPLAB Harmony 3 Touch Library is a royalty-free software library for developing touch applications on 32-bit microcontrollers with Peripheral Touch Controller peripheral.
Developers can use it to integrate touch-sensing capability into their applications. The library supports both self-capacitance and mutual-capacitance acquisition methods.

MPLAB Harmony 3 is an extension of the MPLABï¿½ ecosystem for creating
embedded firmware solutions for Microchip 32-bit SAM and PIC microcontroller
and microprocessor devices.  Refer to the following links for more information.
